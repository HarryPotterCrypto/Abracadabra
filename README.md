# Abracadabra
"Abracadabra" is a mysterious word with an unknown origin, first appearing in the second-century works of Serenus Sammonicus according to the Oxford English Dictionary.

There are various folk etymologies associated with the word, ranging from Hebrew and Aramaic phrases meaning "I will create as I speak" to connections with Latin and Greek words like "abraxas" or its similarity to the first four letters of the Greek alphabet. However, no concrete evidence supports these conjectures.

Historically, the word was mentioned in the second century AD by Serenus Sammonicus, a physician to the Roman emperor Caracalla. He recommended wearing an amulet with "abracadabra" written in a triangular form to cure malaria, claiming its power could heal deadly diseases. Other Roman emperors like Geta and Severus Alexander may have also used this incantation.

The Gnostics, particularly the sect of Basilides, used "abracadabra" as a magical formula to seek aid from benevolent spirits against illness and misfortune. It appeared on amulets called Abraxas stones.

In later times, the word lost its magical connotations. Puritan minister Increase Mather and writer Daniel Defoe dismissed its power, and it was used by Londoners during the Great Plague without success.

In the religion of Thelema, the word is spelled "Abrahadabra" and is considered a magical formula of the current Aeon by its founder, Aleister Crowley. It played a significant role in the founding of Thelema in 1904.

Today, "Abracadabra" is more commonly associated with stage magic and is often used as a magic word during magic tricks.
